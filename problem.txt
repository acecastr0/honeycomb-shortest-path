Create a program that will calculate the shortest path between two hexagons in a honeycomb grid.

The grid is a hexagon with 6 sides, each side containing 331 hexagons starting from index 1.
The center hexagon is index 1, hexagon 2 will be on top of hexagon 1, hexagon 3 will be on the right of hexagon 1, and so on. A clockwise rotation is used.
The structure should look like a honeycomb grid.

The program should take two hexagon indices as input and output the shortest path between them.

The shortest path is calculated by the number of hexagons traversed, not the distance.
